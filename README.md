# Inventory-Control-and-Demand-Forecasting

•	Checked Stationarity through KPSS and Augmented Dickey-Fuller Tests, used ARIMA to decompose the demand into the trend, seasonal, and random error components and predict future demand with each additional month, placed demand predictions and error terms into models (deterministic and stochastic)
•	Minimized the cost of holding and lost sales, performed a two-sample Chi-square test to ensure that the training and validation have the same distribution, selected Deterministic models
